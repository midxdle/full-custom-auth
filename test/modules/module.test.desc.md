The code you've provided includes utility functions and setup for creating a base NestJS testing module and application for testing purposes. Let's break down the code and understand its structure and functionality:

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports necessary modules and functions from `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/testing`, and other related modules.

2. **`createBaseTestingModule` Function**:
   - This function creates a base testing module using the provided `metadata` (ModuleMetadata).
   - It sets up various modules, including configuration, internationalization (i18n), JSON Web Token (JWT), Mongoose, and other custom modules.
   - The modules specified in the `metadata` are imported, and additional modules like `CryptoModule` and `UserModule` are also included.
   - It configures providers, exports, and controllers based on the `metadata`.

3. **`createBaseNestApplication` Function**:
   - This function creates a base NestJS application using the provided `moduleFixture`.
   - It sets up a NestJS application and applies a global validation pipe to handle input validation.

4. **`closeAllConnections` Function**:
   - This function is used to close all connections related to the specified `module` (either a NestJS testing module or an application).
   - It calls `closeMongoServerConnection` to close the MongoDB server connection.
   - It then closes the specified `module`.

These utility functions aid in setting up a consistent testing environment for NestJS applications. They allow for easier configuration and setup of testing modules and applications, as well as proper cleanup of connections after testing.

Overall, this code simplifies the setup and teardown process for testing NestJS applications by providing reusable functions to create testing modules and applications while handling connection cleanup.
