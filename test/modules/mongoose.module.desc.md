The code you've provided contains utility functions related to setting up and closing connections to a MongoDB server, particularly useful for testing with Jest and MongoDB in a NestJS application. Let's break down the code and its structure:

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports necessary modules from `@nestjs/mongoose` and `mongodb-memory-server`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `mongoServer`: A variable to hold an instance of `MongoMemoryServer`, which is used to spin up an in-memory MongoDB server for testing.

3. **`testMongooseModule` Function**:
   - This function sets up a Mongoose module for testing purposes.
   - It takes an optional `MongooseModuleOptions` object as an argument, allowing additional options for Mongoose configuration.
   - It uses `MongooseModule.forRootAsync` to configure the Mongoose module asynchronously, using a factory function.
   - The factory function creates and configures an in-memory MongoDB server using `MongoMemoryServer`.
   - It returns the MongoDB URI and additional options merged with the provided options.

4. **`closeMongoServerConnection` Function**:
   - This function is used to close the connection to the MongoDB server after the tests.
   - It checks if `mongoServer` is defined (meaning a MongoDB server instance was created), and if so, it stops the server.

These utility functions are helpful for testing NestJS applications that use MongoDB as their database. The `testMongooseModule` function allows you to easily set up a Mongoose module using an in-memory MongoDB server, which is useful for unit or integration tests. The `closeMongoServerConnection` function ensures that the MongoDB server is properly closed after testing, preventing resource leaks.
