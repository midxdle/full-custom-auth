1. `"singleQuote": true`:
   - Specifies that the code should use single quotes (`'`) for string literals instead of double quotes (`"`).
   - This is a common code style preference in many projects.

2. `"trailingComma": "all"`:
   - Specifies that a trailing comma should be added after elements in arrays and objects.
   - `"all"` means a trailing comma will be added to all elements if possible, improving code maintainability when adding or removing elements in a list.

These settings enhance code readability and consistency by enforcing specific formatting rules, promoting a standardized code style across the project.
