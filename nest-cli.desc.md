1. `"$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/nest-cli"`:
   - Specifies the JSON schema for validating the `nest-cli.json` file. The URL points to the JSON schema used for validation.

2. `"collection": "@nestjs/schematics"`:
   - Specifies the schematic collection to use for generating NestJS code using the NestJS CLI.
   - In this case, it uses the official NestJS schematic collection.

3. `"sourceRoot": "src"`:
   - Specifies the source root directory for the project. This is where your source code is located.
   - In this case, it's set to `"src"`.

4. `"compilerOptions"`:
   - Contains compiler-related options for the NestJS CLI.

   a. `"deleteOutDir": true`:
      - Specifies whether to delete the output directory (`outDir`) before each build.
      - If set to `true`, the output directory will be deleted before compiling.

   b. `"assets"`:
      - Specifies assets to include during the build process.
      - Here, it includes assets using a pattern and allows watching assets for changes.

   c. `{ "include": "auth/helpers/i18n/**/*", "watchAssets": true }`:
      - Specifies an asset to include using a pattern.
      - `"include": "auth/helpers/i18n/**/*"`: Includes all files and subdirectories in the `auth/helpers/i18n` directory.
      - `"watchAssets": true`: Allows the CLI to watch these assets for changes during development.

Overall, this `nest-cli.json` configuration sets up the NestJS CLI to use a specific schematic collection, defines the source root directory, and configures compiler options related to deleting the output directory and including assets during the build process.
