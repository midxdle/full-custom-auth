The provided code defines a TypeScript function named `isObject` which determines whether a given value is an object (excluding arrays). Let's break down the code and explain it step by step:

```typescript
export function isObject(obj: unknown) {
  return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && !Array.isArray(obj);
}
```

- `export` allows this function to be used in other files by importing it.
- `function isObject(obj: unknown)` defines a function named `isObject` that takes one argument of type `unknown`, named `obj`.
  - `unknown` is a TypeScript type that represents any value and is used when the type of a value is not known or not important.

The function uses a logical expression to determine if the provided argument is an object (excluding arrays) by checking three conditions:

1. `typeof obj === 'object'`: Checks if the type of `obj` is `'object'`. This is true for objects (including arrays) and `null`.
2. `obj !== null`: Ensures that `obj` is not `null`.
3. `!Array.isArray(obj)`: Checks if `obj` is not an array. This excludes arrays from being considered as objects.

The function returns `true` if all three conditions are true, indicating that the provided value is an object (excluding arrays). Otherwise, it returns `false`.
